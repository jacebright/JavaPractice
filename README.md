# JavaPractice
# Overview

This repository is a sample of my first coding in the Java language. I have had experience in other languages such as C# and Python and felt it was important to begin to delve into Java as it is a fundamental part of over 50% of applications. 

The software sampled here is a Board Game Recommendations Graphical User Interface. The GUI utilizes a list of games from my personal collection to display likely games a user might like to play based on a preference in genre (historical games, 2 player games, etc). 

I wrote this software to provide myself a starting place that I can learn about the Java language in a way that is meaningful to me. I hope to expound on this software to create a mobile application that will be of benefit to me personally, and hopefully to others as well.

# Development Environment

I utilized the Eclipse IDE as it provides many helpful tools in seeing the possible methods for any given object. This IDE additionally helped with the file structure of my software so I could focus on the code at this time.

I utilized the Java programming language as the base for this software and utilized the Swing library for the main source of the graphical interface.

# Future Work

- Add functionality to allow a user to input games they enjoy to filter down their search
- Link to a BGG API to create a larger database of games and genres
- Improve the appearance of the GUI for user satisfaction
